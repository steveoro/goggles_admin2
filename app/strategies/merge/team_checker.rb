  # Countrary to other "checker" classes, the TeamChecker does not halt in case of conflicts.
  # Any duplicated badges resulting from a team merge must be processed afterwards using
  # the Merge::Badge strategy.

  # Use Merge::TeamChecker#shared_badge_couples after a team merge to loop over all Badge
  # merge candidates that may need to be processed.
