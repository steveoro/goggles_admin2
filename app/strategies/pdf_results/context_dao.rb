  #   - version:  7-0.7.25
  #   - author:   Steve A.
  #
  # Wraps a subset of contextual data extracted from PDF/TXT parsing
  # into a hierarchy-capable object.
  #
  # ContextDAOs:
  # - can store #rows of sibling ContextDAOs, if the source ContextDef acts as a parent for them;
  #   (adding rows is not done internally: add_row(sibling_dao) needs to be called explicitly)
  #
  # - have a #field_hash, which is the flat Hash map of all field names & values collected
  #   from the source ContextDef (which, in turn, treats all its fields & rows as same-level data)
  #
  # == In depth:
  #
  # While ContextDef store the format definition which is used to parse context sections
  # of text and can divide each same section of text in multiple sibling rows of sub-contexts,
  # ContextDAO store all data collected from the specified source ContextDef as same-level
  # fields and values.
  #
  # At the same time, nesting data is possible within ContextDAO if the source ContextDef
  # acts as parent context for other siblings, in which case using #add_row(context_dao)
  # you can add multiple data rows associated to the same parent DAO.
  #
  # As a practical example, assuming we have a hierarchy of 3 nested ContextDefs like these:...
  #
  #   (root) 'event' ---[1:N]---> 'category' ---[1:N]---> 'result' (leaf)
  #                           (#rows of 'event')     (#rows of 'category')
  #
  # ...A single ContextDef('event') can store all associated 'categories' inside its
  # #rows member, with each item storing a list of 'results' for each possible 'category'.
  #
  # This way, by scanning a list of root-level DAO objects we can reconstruct the whole data
  # hierarchy in a single pass.
  #
  # === NOTE:
  # Do not confuse layout format hierarchy (from ContextDef field groups and sub-area sections)
  # with actual data hierarchy (basically given by ContextDef 'parent' property).
  #
  # Any data extracted from a single ContextDef will be treated as coming from a single level
  # of depth in the data hierarchy, regardless of how many rows the ContextDef spans.
  # (All of its fields will become same-level keys in the resulting #data_hash).
  #
  class ContextDAO

    # Array of sibling ContextDAOs, added with #add_row(context_dao)
    attr_reader :rows

    # Hash of all fields (names, together with their associated value) collected from the
    # source ContextDef.
    #
    # Fields will be retrieved directly from the parent context inside:
    # - actual fields definitions;
    # - any nested field definition found in any sub-context rows.
    #
    # Note that same-named fields stored under different rows will overwrite each other.
    attr_reader :fields_hash

    # Creates a new context DAO, wrapping all data extracted from a single run
    # of ContextDef#extract(<buffer>, <scan_index>).
    #
    # == Params:
    # - +context+ => direct link to source ContextDef instance; +nil+ (default) for a top-level DAO only.
    #                Top-level DAOs won't have a key and will all be named 'root' and all root-level ContextDefs
    #                will yield DAOs stored as #rows.

      @parent = context&.parent&.dao
      # NOTE: if "parent&.dao" ^^^ here raises an error, then the format definition has referenced a parent which hasn't been defined at all.
      # E.g.:
      # "NoMethodError - undefined method `dao' for "category":String"
      #    => context referenced 'category' as parent without actually defining it elsewhere in the format file. (Most probaly a copy&paste mistake)

      # Store reference to parent name for whenever the parent DAO is not found in the hierarchy.
      # (in this case, the first matching name during merge will be used as destination parent - see #merge)
      #
      # == Typical example:
      # Some layouts may not have a repeated 'header' section on each page and still use different
      # layout format files for each page; in this case, the parent name will continue to reference
      # the 'header' while the @parent link would be nil (as no parent DAO is found during the parsing).
      # During the merge, the first context named 'header' found in the hierarchy will be used as
      # the actual destination parent event though the @parent link is still nil.
      # Without a reference to the parent name, the merge would add any sibling context with a nil
      # parent to the root level, which is NOT what we want (creating orphans).

    # If the parent referenced by +source_dao+ is not found inside
    # the DAO hierarchy starting at this instance (going deeper with the
    # subtree), an error is raised.
    #
    # === Note:
    # To prevent exceptions, merges should be performed only on a root DAO
    # when all zero-depth level DAOs have already been found.
    #
    # If the exception persist during runs, this usually signals that
    # the format definitions used to create the ContextDefs from which
    # the DAOs are extracted may contain logical errors, such as a parent
    # context definition written after its siblings' reference.
    #
    # (Parent context sections should always be defined before their siblings.)
    #
    # === Note on structure merge:
    # Each DAO can store a different data hierarchy subtree. This merge
    # aims at merging two different data subtrees into the same parent node.
    #
    #     <self DAO(name, key, parent)> (target / destination)
    #        |
    #        |    <-- merge --|  <source DAO (name, key, parent)>
    #        |                       |
    #     [rows]                     |
    #                              [rows]
    #
    # Part of the merging process requires finding the correct parent for the source DAO
    # and its rows. The parent could be this same DAO instance or any other DAO in its
    # sibling rows.
    #
    # Given that two DAOs are considered equals in value whenever they have the same name & key,
    # "merging" actually implies adding just the sub-rows from the source to
    # the destination node, preserving the existing rows while adding only what
    # is really missing from the destination DAO.
    #
    # The only exception to the above rule is for headers: given that PDFs are assumed to
    # refer to a single Meeting and the header should contain a key referencing to a single
    # meeting, BUT, sometimes key data like the 'meeting_place' or the 'meeting_date' is
    # not rendered on *all* pages in some of the formats (like 'goswim', for one),
    # to prevent duplicated headers due to slighlty different DAO keys, a special check
    # will be performed if the merging source_dao is named 'header' and its already
    # contained inside the children rows. In this case, the 2 slightly-different 'headers'
    # will have the fields and row merged into one (overlapping any existing values).
    #
    # == Practical use case:
    # - (1:N) events --> (1:N) category x event --> (1:N) results x category
    # - Event or category change/reset on each page;
    # - DAOs collected on a per-page basis, w/ parent section (DAO nodes) repeating on each page
    #   --> AIM: single DAO tree => requires a merge of DAO subtrees
    #
    # == Algorithm / pseudo-code:
    # A) Find SELF from dest_parent
    # B) if self not found => add to dest_parent @rows
    # C) if self => check for missing rows & merge iteratively:
    #      found_dao.rows.each { |subdao| subdao compare if missing or not // MERGE }
