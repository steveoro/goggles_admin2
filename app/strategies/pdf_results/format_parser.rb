  #   - author:   Steve A.
  #
  # Given at least a single whole page of a text file, this strategy class will try to detect
  # which known layout format the text file belongs to.
  #
  # Scans all existing YAML format files stored at 'app/strategies/pdf_results/formats'.
  # Each file is assumed to contain a list of valid ContextDef properties definitions.
  # First format file definition found valid & satisfied wins.
  #
  #
  # === Format files, families of format files and subformats
  #
  # Sub-format files are normal format files belonging to the same "family of formats" and with
  # a common shared ancestor. Sub-formats have a suffix appended just after the shared part
  # of the name of the "main" ancestor format (which is assumed to have the format family name):
  #
  #   "<MAIN_FORMAT_FAMILY_NAME>.<SUBFORMAT>.yml"
  #
  # During layout detection, the FormatParser will load all format (and subformat) files found.
  # When a format "wins" the detection, all formats with a name that includes the same detected
  # family name will be kept and iteratively checked, page-by-page.
  #
  # This allows us to parse multi-format files as long as the format change happens at
  # page start.
  #
  # Different formats belonging to the same family must have different names, but can use
  # the same name for ContextDefs related to the same destination data fields.
  # (That is: 2 different 'event' ContextDefs belonging to 2 different formats but belonging
  #  to the same family can share the same 'event' name, independently from the actual destination
  #  data fields collected therein.)

    # Creates a new FormatParser given a source pathname pointing to a valid text file
    # to be parsed and analyzed.
    #
    # FormatParser will split & scan multiple pages assuming EOP are using the ASCII Form-feed
    # character (DEC 12, HEX 0C => "\x0c").
    #
    # Multiple formats per single file are supported, as long as a *single* format is used
    # on each page.
    #
    # FormatParser will use the first format found valid to determine which "family" of formats
    # will be using for the rest of the file and will carry on using that same successful format
    # until the required format definitions (ContextDef) in the current format are no
    # longer satisfied on the current page.
    # Consequently, it will then loop on all remaining sub-formats belonging on the same family until a
    # new successful one is found while progressing with the page parsing.
    #
    # The parsing using #scan() may stop before the last page if no more valid formats are existing
    # in the applied format family.
    #
    # To force a specific format on a group of pages, use #parse() instead.
    #
    # == Params
    # - <tt>filename</tt> => a full pathname to the source text document to be scanned/parsed.
    #
    # - <tt>skip_logging</tt> => skip parsing operations logging; logging creates a file with the
    #   same basename as the source document with a '.log' extension. Default: false.
    #
    # - <tt>verbose_log</tt> => enables the debug logging of the main steps inside ContextDef#valid?()
    #                           for *each* context call. Mostly useful only when parsing or testing single
    #                           pages as the log file will quickly become huge in size for more than one.
    #                           Default: false.
    #
    # - <tt>:debug</tt> => override for the default +false+;
    #                      when +true+ the log messages will also be redirected to the system console
    #                      as an addition to the default log file created using the same basename as the source document.
    #
    # === Example usage:
    #
    # Full document scan with verbose logging on console:
    #
    # > fp = PdfResults::FormatParser.new(<path_to_result_file_converted_from_pdf>.txt')
    # > fp.scan(debug: true) # default: false
    #
    # Partial document scan with verbose logging on console:
    #
    # > fp.scan(pages: 10..15, debug: true)
    #
    # Focused parsing, using just a specific format:
    #
    # > fp.parse('app/strategies/pdf_results/formats/1-ficr1.100m.yml', pages: 0..5, debug: true)
    #
    def initialize(filename, skip_logging: false, verbose_log: false, debug: false)
      @document = File.read(filename)
      @verbose_log = verbose_log
      detect_season_from_pathname(filename)
      prepare_logger(filename) unless skip_logging
      @debug = debug
      set_current_page_rows
      detect_empty_page_moving_fwd
    end

    # === TL'DR:
    # Scans a text document in whole or in part, calling repeatedly #parse() on the first page
    # until a known format family is detected and parses successfully the whole first page.
    # After the first successful format family is found, each page is parsed looping on all
    # sub-formats for the same family, until the rest of the document is parsed or the all
    # the sub-formats are successful again (in which case the loop halts and the parsing process
    # fails).
    # ---
    #
    # Detects & returns which known layout format the data file belongs to.
    # Sets the +result_format_type+ with the name/key of the first matching format found for the
    # first page specified in the constructor.
    #
    # Each #scan invocation clears both the #log and #daos.
    # Returns +nil+ when the file uses an unknown format (unknown considered all format
    # files found) or in case of errors.
    #
    # After the first page of the source document is scanned, the "winning" format
    # will also set the format family.
    # After each page break (if any), only formats belonging to the same format family
    # will be checked for validation whenever the original "winning" format stops
    # being valid for any reason.
    #
    # (This allows to have files with multiple formats in them, as long as they all
    # belong to the same family and, possibly, format changes occur only at page change.
    # If that is not the case, the text data file to be parsed will need to be edited, introducing
    # page changes everywhere the format changes.)
    #
    # The scan ends either when the last document line is reached or there are
    # no more applicable (file) formats to be checked against the remaining pages.
    #
    # == Options
    # - <tt>:ffamily_filter</tt> => specify the format family basename for force a focused scanning
    #   just on that family of formats; leave blank to scan using all available formats.
    #   ("First valid found, first served.")
    #
    # - <tt>:limit_pages</tt> => a single integer or a range of values, identifying the processed
    #   pages (0..COUNT-1); default: +nil+ to parse the whole source file.
    #   Any starting value will make the document page index start from that point and continue
    #   until the end of the document or the ending page index value, if set.
    #
    # - <tt>:debug</tt> => override for the default +false+; when +true+ the log messages
    #   will also be redirected to the system console as an addition to the default log file
    #   created using the same basename as the source document.
